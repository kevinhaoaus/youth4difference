# VolunteerVibe Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Building a social volunteering platform MVP that connects students with organizations for easy event discovery and registration.

## Implementation Plan - Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

### 1. Project Setup & Dependencies
- [ ] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind
- [ ] Install required dependencies (Supabase, UI libraries, form handling)
- [ ] Set up project structure and configuration files
- [ ] Configure environment variables and middleware

### 2. Database & Backend Setup
- [ ] Create Supabase project
- [ ] Set up database schema (users, profiles, events, registrations)
- [ ] Configure Row Level Security policies
- [ ] Set up authentication triggers and functions
- [ ] Test database connections and basic queries

### 3. Core UI Components
- [ ] Create reusable UI components (Button, Input, etc.)
- [ ] Set up utility functions (cn helper, styling)
- [ ] Configure Tailwind theme and global styles
- [ ] Create app layout and root styling

### 4. Authentication System
- [ ] Build student authentication form component
- [ ] Build organization authentication form component
- [ ] Create authentication pages (login, org-login)
- [ ] Set up Supabase client and server configurations
- [ ] Implement middleware for protected routes

### 5. Student Dashboard
- [ ] Create student dashboard page with user verification
- [ ] Build dashboard header component
- [ ] Implement event feed component with real-time data
- [ ] Add event registration/unregistration functionality
- [ ] Style for mobile-first responsive design

### 6. Organization Dashboard
- [ ] Create organization dashboard page
- [ ] Build organization header component
- [ ] Implement events list component for organizations
- [ ] Add event creation form and page
- [ ] Include event management features (delete, view registrations)

### 7. Landing Page & Navigation
- [ ] Create attractive landing page with features showcase
- [ ] Add navigation between student and organization portals
- [ ] Ensure responsive design across all screen sizes

### 8. API Routes & Advanced Features
- [ ] Create event discovery API with location filtering
- [ ] Build event registration API endpoints
- [ ] Add error handling and validation
- [ ] Implement toast notifications throughout app

### 9. Testing & Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Test all authentication flows
- [ ] Verify event creation and registration workflows
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness on various devices
- [ ] Prepare environment variables for production
- [ ] Test database permissions and security

### 10. Final Polish & Deployment
- [ ] Review and optimize component performance
- [ ] Add loading states and error boundaries
- [ ] Set up deployment on Vercel
- [ ] Configure production environment variables
- [ ] Test full application flow in production

## Implementation Notes
- **Simplicity First**: Each task should be implemented with minimal complexity
- **Mobile-First**: All components should work perfectly on mobile devices
- **Real-time Ready**: Use Supabase's real-time features for live updates
- **Secure by Design**: Implement proper RLS policies from the start

## Next Steps
After completing this MVP, the following features can be added:
- Friend connections and social features
- Advanced location filtering with maps
- University email verification
- Push notifications
- Enhanced event discovery algorithms
